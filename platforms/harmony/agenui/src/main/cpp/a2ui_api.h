 * @brief Abstraction layer between the A2UI C++ runtime and the ArkTS host.
 *
 * IHarmonyNAPI is the single seam through which C++ code looks up ArkTS
 * callbacks registered by the host application. The concrete implementation
 * (HarmonyNAPI in napi_init.cpp) maintains a name-keyed registry of ETS
 * functions and serialises access with std::mutex.
 *
 * Higher-level bridge utilities (HMHelper, ImageLoaderBridge,
 * SkillInvokerHelper) build on top of this interface rather than accessing
 * the NAPI layer directly.
 *
 * The singleton instance is created and destroyed by napi_init.cpp and
 * accessed globally via implHarmonyNAPI().
