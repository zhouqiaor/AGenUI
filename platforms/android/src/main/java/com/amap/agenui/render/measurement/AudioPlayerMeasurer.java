/**
 * Intrinsic measurement for the leaf AudioPlayer component.
 *
 * Yoga only calls into this measurer after a measureFunc has been registered and the node still
 * needs content-based sizing. Typical trigger cases:
 * 1. Component styles leave width / height as `auto`, so the default square player size is needed.
 * 2. Parent layout passes AT_MOST / EXACT constraints and the default size must be clamped.
 *
 * If both axes are already fully determined by style + parent constraints, Yoga may skip the
 * callback entirely even though the measurement implementation is registered.
