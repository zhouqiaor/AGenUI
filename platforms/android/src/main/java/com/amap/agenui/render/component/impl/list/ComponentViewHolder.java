/**
 * Thin RecyclerView holder that hosts an A2UIComponent's real Android view as its
 * single child.
 *
 * Why a holder + ShadowFrameLayout shell rather than using component.view directly as
 * itemView:
 * 1. RecyclerView mutates itemView's LayoutParams. We do NOT want that mutation
 *    to happen on component.view (which Component HAS-A and uses outside the RV
 *    context too). The shell absorbs all RV-level layout mutations.
 * 2. ViewHolder reuse: multiple A2UIComponents may pass through this same shell
 *    over the lifetime of the RV. attach()/detach() swaps the inner child without
 *    affecting the shell.
 * 3. The shell is a ShadowFrameLayout so that item shadows (filter: drop-shadow)
 *    are painted by the shell's drawChild, keeping sibling Z-order unaffected.
 *
 * The shell does NOT carry any per-component layout: child position inside the
 * RV is set by YogaLayoutManager.layoutDecorated(itemView, frame.left, frame.top,
 * ...). Inside the shell, the component view is positioned at (0,0) with the
 * yoga-computed size (see attach()).

     * 2. Force-detach the incoming component view from any other parent
     *    (covers RV-recycle race where the same component view was attached to
     *    a sibling holder still in the recycler pool — solves AND-P0-5).
     * 3. Reset the component view's LayoutParams to (0, 0, yogaW, yogaH) — RV
     *    relies on layoutDecorated for positioning, the inner view must not
     *    carry yoga x/y as margins (solves AND-P0-2 double-offset).
     * 4. Add the component view as the shell's only child.
