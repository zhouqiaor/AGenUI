 * and destroyed on stop.
 *
 * The map-based storage is designed to be extensible, allowing multiple independent
 * threads to be registered in the future (e.g. one dedicated thread per engine instance).
 *
 * Thread safety:
 * - Thread map is protected by a mutex
 * - Thread creation and destruction are managed centrally
