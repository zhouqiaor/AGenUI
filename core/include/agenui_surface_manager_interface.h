 * @brief SurfaceManager external interface

 * Multi-instance context manager. Each ISurfaceManager corresponds to an independent UI rendering context,
 * with independent card management, data binding, protocol parsing, and event callback chains.
 * Lifecycle is managed by IAGenUIEngine:
 * - Created via IAGenUIEngine::createSurfaceManager()
 * - Destroyed via IAGenUIEngine::destroySurfaceManager()
 *
 * Thread convention:
 * - All external interfaces are called on the business thread
 * - Internal logic is processed on a sub-thread (shared by all SurfaceManager instances), event callbacks to listener are on the sub-thread
 * Data isolation note:
 *  - Each SurfaceManager has independent streaming data buffers and callbacks; different data streams can be bound to different SurfaceManager instances
